# Advent of Code
Advent of Code is a 25-day long set of daily programming puzzles which can be found [here](https://adventofcode.com).

The difficulty generally increases over time. As of writing this, I have completed years 2016-2018 of AoC starting with Javascript and eventually using it to learn Python.

*For solutions in a programming language, switch to a different branch named accordingly.*
