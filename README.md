# Advent of Code
Advent of Code is a 25-day long set of daily programming puzzles which can be found [here](https://adventofcode.com).

The difficulty generally increases over time. As of writing this, I have completed years 2016-2018 of AoC starting with Javascript and eventually using it to learn Python.

I also started developing a tool to assist with common tasks that come up with Advent of Code, including fetching the data from the website and basic structures which reoccur (2D grids, product of numbers, Manhattan distance, priority queues, etc.)
